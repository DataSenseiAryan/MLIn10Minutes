    "# 1. The Data Science of Shoelaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Nike has hired you as a data science consultant to help them save money on shoe materials. Your first assignment is to review a model one of their employees built to predict how many shoelaces they'll need each month. The features going into the machine learning model include:\n",
    "- The current month (January, February, etc)\n",
    "- Advertising expenditures in the previous month\n",
    "- Various macroeconomic features (like the unemployment rate) as of the beginning of the current month\n",
    "- The amount of leather they ended up using in the current month\n",
    "\n",
    "The results show the model is almost perfectly accurate if you include the feature about how much leather they used. But it is only moderately accurate if you leave that feature out. You realize this is because the amount of leather they use is a perfect indicator of how many shoes they produce, which in turn tells you how many shoelaces they need.\n",

    "This is tricky, and it depends on details of how data is collected (which is common when thinking about leakage). Would you at the beginning of the month decide how much leather will be used that month? If so, this is ok. But if that is determined during the month, you would not have access to it when you make the prediction. If you have a guess at the beginning of the month, and it is subsequently changed during the month, the actual amount used during the month cannot be used as a feature (because it causes leakage)."

If they order leather first, then you'll have that number available when you place your shoelace order, and you should be ok."

    "There is no source of leakage here. These features should be available at the moment you want to make a predition, and they're unlikely to be changed in the training data after the prediction target is determined. But, the way he describes accuracy could be misleading if you aren't careful. If the price moves gradually, today's price will be an accurate predictor of tomorrow's price, but it may not tell you whether it's a good time to invest. For instance, if it is  100today,amodelpredictingapriceof100today,amodelpredictingapriceof 100 tomorrow may seem accurate, even if it can't tell you whether the price is going up or down from the current price. A better prediction target would be the change in price over the next day. If you can consistently predict whether the price is about to go up or down (and by how much), you may have a winning investment opportunity."

    "\n",
    "You have target leakage if a given patient's outcome contributes to the infection rate for his surgeon, which is then plugged back into the prediction model for whether that patient becomes infected. You can avoid target leakage if you calculate the surgeon's infection rate by using only the surgeries before the patient we are predicting for. Calculating this for each surgery in your training data may be a little tricky.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also have a train-test contamination problem if you calculate this using all surgeries a surgeon performed, including those from the test-set. The result would be that your model could look very accurate on the test set, even if it wouldn't generalize well to new patients after the model is deployed. This would happen because the surgeon-risk feature accounts for data in the test set. Test sets exist to estimate how the model will do when seeing new data. So this contamination defeats the purpose of the test set."
